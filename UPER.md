<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* I'm going to make a Hangman, 2D terminal game.
* A player will be given a random word and, a description to guess. 
* A player can make 6 mistakes.
* After each mistake, a part of the hangman will be drawn. Game is over when all 6 mistakes spent and a hangman is fully drawn
*
